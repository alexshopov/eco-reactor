# Eco Reactor

Entry for the GMTK Game Jam 2025.

A game about maintaining a stable closed-loop life support system through resource management

Assemble a tiny self-sustaining ecosystem using interconnected modules like water purifiers, algae tanks, compost digesters, and air scrubbers. Every component has inputs and outputs. The goal is to create closed feedback loops where no resource is wasted.


## Baseline Behavior

O2 slowly decreases - no plant life producing it

CO2 slowly increases - ambient biological decay

Water slowly decreases - Evaporation

Biomass slowly decreases - passive decay over time
